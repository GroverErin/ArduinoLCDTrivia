# ArduinoLCDTrivia
## A STEM Trivia Game

This was my very first attempt at writing any code, before I even knew what C/C++ even was. This is the project that made me fall in love with programming,
and is the reason why I changed my degree from Automotive/Mechanical Engineering to Software Engineering. For this reason, as terrible as this code is,
this is my favorite project.

While I was an Automotive Engineering student at Arizona State University, my engineering team and I were tasked with making an interactive game for a 2nd
grade classroom. We decided to make a STEM Bingo/Trivia game using an Arduino, and a constructed "self-contained holder" for the game. I wish I still had
photos of the whole project. The container was a Cube, with the Arduino and LCD Shield inlayed into the surface, and inside the cube was a series of compartments
that contained everything necessary for a bingo game for a class of around 25 students. The cube itself was painted to match Arizona State Universities school colors.

I was tasked with writing the code for the Arduino to actually ask the questions based on user input (There were buttons on the LCD Shield), and display them to the LCD display.
This repo contains that code.

I spent way more time on this assignment than I should have, and most of that time was spent inside the tutoring center on campus getting help from one of the Softawre Engineering
students. I wish I remembered his name, because I'd like to tell him thanks again!

I'll probably rewrite this someday with my current knowledge to see how far I've come... Maybe I'll even order the LCD and give it a test.

I've provided the Arduino `.ino` file, in the *very* small chance anyone would want to give it a test.
